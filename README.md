**BashScripting**

Bash Scripting study. The script folder only contains some of the scripts, if you want the explaination or you want more scripts use the scripts_lessons.ctb file. On order to use the script_lesson.ctb (this is the recommended file) you will require a linux machine that has cherrytree installed in it.
